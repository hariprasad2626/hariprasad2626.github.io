<div id="p1"><p>My education started a bit late in my childhood.In my school 
i used to be very dull, my parents and my teachers are always used to punish me
. This made me to hate education at that time. Then i started cheating my parents 
and some times teachers by copying others in the exam.After listening to some of the 
biographies of great people it made me to change in my character. Finally i passed 
my 10th class and enterd in to the 11th class.

</p></div>
<div id="p2"><p> After coming to 11th class which is considerd as very important 
time in andhra as iit jee preparation starts from that time and i started studying
seriously. I joined in a hostel, for the frist time i left my home. unfortunately
i have not able to crack jee-advanced even mains too.This disappointed  me much
. One day i read an article in the news paper about a great college iit kharagpur
. They have explained all about their college like infrastucture, mentorship for frist years
and so on. This made me passionate of cracking jee again. I decided to take another years
for preparation. This time i kept all my endeavours in preperation finally i cracked
jee as well as my dream was successfull as i got the seat in the great college of which
i read in the news paper iit kharagpur.  </p></div>
