day 26th january 1994. It is special day not only for me but  also india as we know 
it is republic day.Everyone distrubutes sweets on their birthday but ironically i 
used to get sweets in my school on my birthday as it is republic day.In my childhood
i used to be very silent with a robustic body. I love to be with my friends.some 
of my best freinds are ashok,chaitanya,ravi. Coming to the foods  i am pure vegterian in my house
and i dont remember how i started to hate non veg in my childhood. I love to watch serials
 power rangers , shakthimaan and i used to imitate them in the bathroom.

<div id="para2"><p>After entering to my school i have learnt many things from my 
friends.They used to encourage me i all the ways. I used to play only indore games 
but all of my friends play only outdoor games in which i am very weak,but they make me
join in their games even they know i dont play well. After coming to the engneering 
i decided to play any outdoor games . So frist i decided to play badminton and
then my choice is changed to tennis. Finally i am still continued to play tennis
and trying for inter hall.
