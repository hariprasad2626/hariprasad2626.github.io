<div id="b2"><p>I selected as school people leader in my school ,i daily used to made prayer
for our school this made get rid of the stage fear.After coming to iit i learnt 
manythings like how to work with a group, how to inculcate leadership qualities
, how to do smart work instead of hard work. Before coming to iit my comunication skills are 
very weak i am practising daily for that . My roomy have helped me alot in improving
my lannguage and i thankful to him. He also made me to incucate the habit of
reading books which i dont have before . I learnt many more things from him and 
every one who i know and i am still continuing to increase my skills in these holidays 
specially sketching because i have seen many people having increadeble skills in sketching
in my collge society called spectra.I think this is the correct oppurtunity for
me . so will practise more to enter in to that society.  </p></div>
